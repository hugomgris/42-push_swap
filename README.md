Project done with bonus and 125 points.

I took the "Turk Algorithm" approach from A. Yigit Ogun's article in Medium (https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97) and build my own code around the explained logic. My code is considerably different from his, so if you want a second build of the same approach (the original one), you should check his repository, linked in the mentioned article.

If you find any bug or problems in the code, please contact me so i can fix it.
